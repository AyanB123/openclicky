//  Shared AVAudioEngine + AVAudioPlayerNode playback plumbing used by the
//  streaming TTS clients (ElevenLabs, Cartesia, Microsoft Edge, OpenAI
//  Realtime, Deepgram). Each client owns its own engine/player instance
//  and lifecycle; these are the pure scheduling/draining/stopping
//  primitives that were previously duplicated per client.
